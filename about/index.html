<p>Well, the short story is that I'm Antti and these sites are kind of like a personal diary, aimed mainly for myself and my friends.</p>
<p>The longer story, from a professional point of view: I'm a PhD student, and I'm working at the University of Eastern Finland's biology department. In my research on the boreal tree species silver birch (<i>Betula pendula</i>), I'm interested in how the effects of latitude and place of origin affect the trees' ecophysiological characteristics, such as their photosynthetic efficiency and growth. Species with wide distributions (such as <i>B. pendula</i>) can have visibly distinct ecotypes depending on where they are growing. For example, a tree from Lapland versus a tree from southern Finland can have general morphological differences, like differing heights, differently coloured and structured leaves etc. or more hidden ones, like differences in their photosynthetic machinery. Part of these differences are probably explained by genetics and different life histories, but trees are also plastic to environmental conditions. Elucidating the genetic and plastic nature of this variation is important, because we need to know how these different ecotypes will react to the changing global climate; if most predictions about the carbon sink capacity of forests are made based on a singular ecotype, we might not be seeing the big picture.</p>
<p> I will undoubtedly be posting biology-related stuff on these sites, but research and biology aside I'm interested in a lot of other things, and these pages are more about that.</p>
<p>My other interests are e.g. music (playing [with] the guitar), programming (I did these sites, yay!), statistics (quite unlikely to be 100% true), photography (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gambina/">I used to do some when I still had time</a>) and homebrewing (I WILL share some recipes!). I've also taken an unhealthy interest in the public discource on genetic modification and some of the not-so-earth-happy aspects of the Organic movement, topics that I want to cover more later on.</p>
<p>Generally speaking I would say that I'm a "concerned citizen" who wants to see and understand patterns in nature and who believes that the quest for knowledge is one of the nobler ones. Science just happens to be the best damn tool deviced so far to get to that knowledge. There are some problems in modern science though, and the more sciency stuff I do, the more concerned I get. In a sense I needed a place to channel these thoughts, and that also was a big motivation for these sites. I'll try to avoid too much cynicism, though, but I am a bit sarcastic sometimes (: Anyways, I hope you find something that interests you in here, and welcome!</p>
