<p>I'm going to start collecting all sorts of interesting/fun stuff from around the web into posts called "Just some links" whenever I've come across any. These will be links to videos, articles and so on that I couldn't tie into a full story, but which I found somehow interesting (nb, none of these have to be especially fresh... interesting things rarely stop being interesting very soon).</p>

<p>So here are the first links!</p>

<p>1) Vox had <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/6/3/11837888/simulation-problem">a fun little lightweight philosophical venture</a> into what Elon Musk said about our reality being a simulation. So, would it matter even if we did live in the Matrix?</p>

<p>2) Theorytab's website has <a href="http://www.hooktheory.com/trends" target="_blank">a pretty interesting tool</a> that let's you analyse the chord progressions from thousands of popular songs. Just follow the percentages and write your own musical masterpiece/trash!
</p>

<p>3) <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Deepak_Chopra">Deepak Chopra</a> apparently deserves his own <a href="http://www.wisdomofchopra.com/">quote-generator</a>. On a very related note, <a href="http://journal.sjdm.org/15/15923a/jdm15923a.pdf">an article</a>.

<p>4) Lastly <a href="https://csc.fi/web/blog/post/-/blogs/ymmarrys-syntyy-kadet-syvalla-datassa">a blog entry</a> from the boss of the Finnish IT center for science, CSC. In Finnish only, sorry.

That's it for now! I'll be back soon with more!
