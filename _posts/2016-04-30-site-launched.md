So, I guess I <i>finally</i> got around to launching this website. It was a long time coming, and with me coming from no real coding background, it was a rocky road. I used to have homepages when I was a kid (some 15 years ago), but back then you didn't have to think about mobile device readability and such. All the same, I saw it as a nice little challenge for myself then and now again.

I had some thoughts about my to-be pages before I decided on the way to approach building them:

* Free of cost while no ads (sounds impossible already...)
* Simplicity in design and code
* Possibility for learning something while making them

Eventually I decided to host static pages on <a href="https://github.com/AnttiTenkanen/anttitenkanen.github.io">GitHub</a>, which also provides a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>-powered solution for blogging. The mobile-first design is basically coming from <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> style sheets. Because of a very different previous experience I had with page building, there was a lot of re-thinking to do, especially with the way Jekyll templating and directory structure works.

The biggest difficulty I had was actually how to itegrate some kind of possibility for commenting into the static design.
