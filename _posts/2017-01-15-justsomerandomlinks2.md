<p>Okay, time for a second posting. Here's some more gold nuggets from around the wild wild web for this fine sunday:</p>
<p>1) In case you completely missed the <a href="https://shapertools.com/">Shaper Origin</a> last year, chech out some of their introductory videos. It's quite astounding, a handheld CNC router that works on any scale. Hope they actually get them to the markets soon...</p>
<p>2) One guy recently talking about the Shaper is Ben Krasnow, the guy who built his own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCdsyCWmt8">electron microscope in his garage.</a>. On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/bkraz333/videos?sort=p&flow=grid&view=0">his Youtube-channel</a>, he has several interesting videos, here's a couple:</p>

<p>I think he might be completely insane (: but all the same it's important to consider how such people come to be. I don't think any amount of education would be enough to create a guy like him, even if education is incredibly important. Quite likely Krasnow isn't completely self-taught, but his skills work mostly for his own merit. Sure, there has to be a fair deal of giftedness in play as well, but I know many a gifted, well-educated people who definately don't amount to such "uomo universale" status. Anyways, a very interesting guy with fun projects.</p>
<p>3) Homeopathy was quite often in <a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9339602">the headlines</a> in Finnish media last year. Especially there was discussion about <a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-8635004">why Finland still doesn't have a law governing alternative medicine</a>. On the same vein, Lauri Reuter writes about <a href="http://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2016/12/30/nakokulma-google-uskoo-homeopatiaan-ja-se-vaarallista">the dangers of homeopathy</a> and in another article about what he thinks is wrong with <a href="http://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2016/07/15/luomu-taytyy-korjata">Organic produce</a> (all links in Finnish). "In the eyes of the scientific community, homeopathy belongs to the same category with angel therapy, unicorns and horoscopes. They're not part of this reality. But that doesn't mean that they should not be written about!" Reuter's writings seem to attract a lot of commenting, and I always read through them. From the comments-section of the homeopathy piece, I found e.g. <a href="http://users.jyu.fi/~merikosk/fysiikka_vs_home.html">a Finnish physic's perspective</a> and <a href="http://www.tervettaskeptisyytta.net/vieraskirjoitus-argumentum-ad-germania/">a very interesting perspective from a Finn living in Germany</a>. The last link also briefly discusses the interplay between homeopathy and other vitalistic practices, like Organic farming, in Germany; very much worth a read if you're new to the subject! It was interesting to read that, for example whereas Finland doesn't regulate alternative medicine, licencing has a long tradition in Germany. It would be interesting to know how many medical doctors in Germany actually offer homeopathy only so that people would rather use their services than resort to more dubious "healers". But most noteworthy, in my opinion, is indeed the intricate connection between several otherwise rather disconnected practices like homeopathy and Organic farming. I will be writing more extensively about this later.</p>
