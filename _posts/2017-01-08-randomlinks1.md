I'm going to start a little tradition of posting all kinds of interesting stuff from around the web on a weekly basis. These weekly updates are, however, such only by name, since I might become lazy or alternatively overly active with posting them. Anyways, these will be links to videos, articles and so on that I couldn't tie into a full story, but which were somehow interesting to me.

So here are the first random links of the week! And of the year!

<p>1) Vox has a fun little lightweight philosophical venture into what Elon Musk said about our reality being a simulation. Worth a read, <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/6/3/11837888/simulation-problem">check it out</a></p>

<p>2) Theorytab's website has <a href="http://www.hooktheory.com/trends" target="_blank">a pretty interesting tool</a> that let's you analyse the chord progressions from thousands of popular songs. Just follow the percentages and write your own musical masterpiece/trash!
