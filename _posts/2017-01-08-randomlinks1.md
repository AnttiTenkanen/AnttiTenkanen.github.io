<p>I'm going to start a little tradition of posting all kinds of interesting/fun stuff from around the web on a weekly basis (if I've come across any, naturally). These weekly updates are, however, such only by name, since I might become lazy or alternatively overly active with posting them. Anyways, these will be links to videos, articles and so on that I couldn't tie into a full story, but which I found somehow interesting (nb, none of these have to be especially fresh... interesting things rarely stop being interesting very soon).</p>

<p>So here are the first links of the week! And of the year!</p>

<p>1) Vox has a fun little lightweight philosophical venture into what Elon Musk said about our reality being a simulation. Worth a read, <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/6/3/11837888/simulation-problem">check it out</a></p>

<p>2) Theorytab's website has <a href="http://www.hooktheory.com/trends" target="_blank">a pretty interesting tool</a> that let's you analyse the chord progressions from thousands of popular songs. Just follow the percentages and write your own musical masterpiece/trash!
</p>

<p>3) <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Deepak_Chopra">Deepak Chopra</a> apparently deserves his own <a href="http://www.wisdomofchopra.com/">quote-generator</a>. On a very related note, <a href="http://journal.sjdm.org/15/15923a/jdm15923a.pdf">an article</a>.

<p>4) Lastly <a href="https://csc.fi/web/blog/post/-/blogs/ymmarrys-syntyy-kadet-syvalla-datassa">a blog entry</a> from the boss of the Finnish IT center for science, CSC. In Finnish only, sorry.

That's it for now! I'll be back soon with more!
