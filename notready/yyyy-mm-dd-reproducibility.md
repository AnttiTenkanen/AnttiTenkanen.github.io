<p>I haven't posted anything in a while, because I have been rather tied up with an experiment. But now that that's done, I thought
it might be fun to poke around the internet once more. Recently, for some reason, I have been reading quite a bit about what is called the
'reproducibility crisis in science'. If you're new to the subject, <a href="http://www.ascb.org/newsletter/2016-marchapril-newsletter/on-reproducibility-and-clocks/">in this link Peter Walter gives a pretty lucid explanation of the problem</a>. Basically, what's happening is that science is losing credibility, because of real and perceived problems in producing and reproducing results. The reasons behind it can be mostly traced to the history and culture of science, and while it can affect the public's opinion on the reliability of science, it is probably more so the scientists who are worried and rushing to action. But in this post-truth age that we live in, the crisis is indeed an issue that requires urgent attention and clarification from the scientific community to the public, and that is also one reason I decided to talk about it.</p>
<br>
<p>In the link above, Walter also clarifies the different nuances of what can actually be meant with "reproduction". He cites an ASCB White Paper on Reproducibility that divides replication into analytical, direct, systematic and conceptual. You should really read the link for a better understanding, but in case you didn't, it would always be prudent to specify what kind of reproducibility issues we are discussing. If we have a specific result, or a set of results, and we want to replicate it (which is of course required for any science to be sound), 

rather than throw the buzzwords 'science', 'reproduction' and 'crisis' around in hysterical news headlines.

<p>But without any practical background in science, it is almost impossible for a normal person to understand what the 'scientific method' actually means in practice, and why science may be just as susceptible to our human flaws (to get a glimpse of this and also to start understanding some of the historical reasons for the crisis, <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-biology/2017/02/22/science-journey-search-destination/?utm_campaign=BMC40646B&utm_medium=BMCemail&utm_source=Teradata">read this short story</a>).</p>
