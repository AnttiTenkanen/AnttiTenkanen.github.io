<p>Some links for any Finnish readers. There was just now a documentary about GMOs shown on the Finnish tv-show <a href="https://yle.fi/aihe/docventures">Docventures</a>. It's a topic which hasn't had that much coverage in the Finnish media, probably because so far there hasn't been any real use of GE-tech in Finnish food production. The documentary itself was the newly released <a href="https://www.foodevolutionmovie.com/">Food Evolution</a>, and it definately stirred up some discussion on social media and on the Finnish national broadcast media Yle's website, for example <a href="https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2017/10/23/riku-rantala-jos-tunnepitoinen-gm-viha-ei-muutu-maapallolta-loppuu-ruoka">here</a> and <a href="https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2017/10/25/kalle-kinnunen-epasuosittu-mielipide-mutta-tieteellinen-totuus-geenimuunneltu>here</a>. There's also a really nice previous writing on the matter <a href="https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2017/02/24/nakokulma-gm-vapautta-myydaan-tunteella-400-gramman-erissa">here</a> by Lauri Reuter.
