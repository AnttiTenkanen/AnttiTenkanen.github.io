<p>So recently at work I was doing <a href = "http://glmm.wikidot.com/faq">linear mixed effect modelling</a>, and I started to wonder if
I could inspect my residual's distribution acoustically. Normally of course you do it visually something like this:</p>
------- kuva normaalista residuaalikuviosta, + eri jakaumia --------------
--------kuvateksti:-------------
<p>I don't know why I hadn't thought it before, but since it's essentially assumed that the residuals are white noise, why not check this
acoustically? I know, it makes no sense, but for a minute I started thinking about it.
